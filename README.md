# DevOps + AIOps Series

> A full end-to-end DevOps project with AIOps integration — so you can connect the dots between how AI is helping automate DevOps tasks today.

---

## Welcome

Hey everyone!

Welcome to my DevOps + AI series where we build an end-to-end DevOps project with an AIOps integration.

A lot of you have been asking: *"when are you going to share a full DevOps project?"*

Well — here we are.

In this series we will:

- Build microservices locally
- Use Claude and AI tools to assist development
- Deploy everything step by step
- Migrate the system to the cloud on AWS EKS
- Set up a full CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Implement GitOps workflows with ArgoCD
- Integrate AIOps capabilities with AWS Bedrock

By the end of this series, you won't just know tools — you'll understand how real DevOps systems are designed and deployed.

## Series Structure

### Part 1 — System Design Foundations
[`docs/part1-system-design.md`](docs/part1-system-design.md)

We start with system design concepts specifically for cloud and DevOps. This is important whether you're a beginner, intermediate, or senior engineer — because companies don't choose tools randomly. They think about architecture patterns, deployment strategies, scalability, reliability, and cost tradeoffs.

We cover 12 core system design pillars used in modern DevOps architectures, and connect each one directly to something running in this project.

---

### Part 2 — Understanding the Workflow
[`docs/part2-workflow.md`](docs/part2-workflow.md)

Before writing any code or deployment configs, you need to understand how the entire system flows:

- What services we're building and how they communicate
- How the pipeline works
- How code moves from developer → CI → deployment → production → AIOps

This is where the full picture comes together — including how AI fits into the workflow.

---

### Part 3 — DevOps Project Implementation
[`docs/part3-demo.md`](docs/part3-demo.md) · [`projects/README.md`](projects/README.md)

Then we actually build the project. You'll see:

- Docker containers and Docker Compose
- Kubernetes deployments on EKS
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- GitOps automation with ArgoCD
- Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform
- Observability with Prometheus and Grafana

---

### Part 4 — AIOps Integration
[`docs/part4-aiops.md`](docs/part4-aiops.md) · [`projects/aiops-assistant/README.md`](projects/aiops-assistant/README.md)

Finally, we explore how AI helps with:

- Monitoring and anomaly detection
- Log analysis at scale
- Incident response automation
- DevOps troubleshooting

Because modern DevOps is no longer just automation — it's **automation + intelligence**.

---

## Bonus Challenge

You'll get access to this entire repository.

But there's a catch.

The repository includes **intentional issues and troubleshooting tasks**.

Why? Because AI has made things easier. But if you want to grow as an engineer, you must learn how to break systems, debug systems, and fix systems.

Once you implement the project:

1. Fork the repository
2. Deploy the system
3. Troubleshoot the issues
4. Share what you learned — and tag me so I know you're building along
